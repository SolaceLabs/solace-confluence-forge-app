## About the App

Solace Event Portal, confluence app is built for the Solace community and solely supported by the Community to integrate Event Portal with Atlassian Confluence.

## Data Collection & Storage

Solace Event Portal does not collect any personal information at any point in time. The permission granted at the time of installation are the ones sought by Atlassian Confluence to enable/install the app on a workspace. 

As an end user, the only information collected is Solace REST API token, which is the API key to access Solace Event Portal. This key is stored as part of Confluence User resource and never stored anywhere else and presented with requests to Event Portal as the macros are invoked. Any feedback on the app is expected to be provided on the GitHub, where the app source code is hosted.

As far as the information returned from Solace Event Portal is simply rendered on the page, and never stored or transferred anywhere.

## Opt-out

As there is no data collected or stored and no cleanup is required. Any time, you can unregister or uninstall the app from your workspace, and be assured that no information is stored anytime, anywhere.
