# Solace PubSub+ Event Portal + Confluence Integration

## About

The Solace PubSub+ Event Portal integration for Confluence gives you and your teams full visibility into your Event Portal resources right in a Confluence page, where you can access information about your Application Domains, Applications, Events, Schemas, Enumerations, Event Apis and Event Api Products. This integration is an open source project, built and maintained by _Solace-Labs_.
