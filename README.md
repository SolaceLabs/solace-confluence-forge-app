# Solace PubSub+ Event Portal + Confluence Integration

## About

The Solace PubSub+ Event Portal integration for Confluence gives you and your teams full visibility into your Event Portal resources right in a Confluence page, where you can access information about your Application Domains, Applications, Events, Schemas, Enumerations, Event Apis and Event Api Products. This integration is an open source project, built and maintained by _Solace-Labs_.

This repository contains one way of using Event Portal in your Software Development Lifecycle, in Confluence. Check out the [Supercharge your Software Development Lifecycle with PubSub+ Event Portal](https://solace.com/blog/software-development-lifecycle-with-event-portal) blog to learn about other ways you can use Event Portal throughout your SDLC. 

The source code is made available as an open-source, on an 'as is' basis for anyone who wants to build or extend the app functionality.
